# This script will plot a normal distribution and a t distribution with n = 1
# degrees freedom. It will then pause until the <enter> key is pressed, then it will
# increment n by 1 and plot again. Under default settings, it will plot 30 times
# and show convergence in the t distribution to the normal distribution as n increases
