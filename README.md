===================

Scripts used in statistics classes for visualizations/illustrations

----

Scripts and their basic functions

1. Confidence Intervals 
    * Plots n level alpha confidence intervals from repeated sampling 
    * Plots 4 samples of incresing sizes and their respective confidence intervals
2. Variance and Bias
    * Plots the standard Mean Squared Error variance/bias "targets" illustration
3. Birthday Problem 
    * Plots a graph of probabilities and the specific probability for a given N in the Birthday Problem (probability of two people in a group of N people having the same birthday)
4. Convergence of the *t*-Distribution to Normal
    * Plots a *t*-distribution converging to a normal distribution. Degrees of freedom (up to 30) are incremented by the user pressing ``` enter ``` 
5. Central Limit Theorem 
	* Shows the mean values of repeated random sampling from a skewed distribution $\chi^2$ distribution converging graphically to a somewhat symmetric distribution ala CLT.
